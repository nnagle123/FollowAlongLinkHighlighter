# FollowAlongLinkHighlighter


<p>This is project 22 in Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 course.  In this lesson we built a simple webpage, and had the a href tags highlight when you mouse over them. This was an interesting project becuse the highlight function needed to change size based on which text was highlighted. </p>

<p>If you're interested in doing the project yourself, you can find the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POP_qri7RA8&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP6CGK4YVJhL_VWetA865GOH&index=22">here.</a></p>
